## Oct 2016 Mentorship

* Can time zones be taken into account when creating pairs? Large time differences make finding a time suitable for both sides difficult.
* Add additional pairing groups. e.g.: 
  * "F# on the web"
  * "Type providers"
  * Compiler topics" 
  * "Machine Learning and Data Science" 
* Give people the option to express language preferences, if that matters, so that compatible people can be paired. That should also help for time zones.
